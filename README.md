==========

a jquery bookmarklet for creating erasures of webpages. uses old versions of jgestures, hammer.js, Brett Barros/Paul Irish's jQuery Bookmarklet, and Ben Allman's replacetext plugin.  follow link for more about + readme.  

(NOTE: this is an incomplete archive saved her for my sense of completeness; i think the colorfully named "erasemark34backupADDFEATURE.js" is the final unminified version of the desktop source but i don't have an original unminified version of the mobile source because i didn't keep records well or have github then)
